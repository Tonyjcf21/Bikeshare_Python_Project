# Bikeshare Project

This project introduces basic Python to **analyze** data and generates an **interactive** script.

TO DO:

  -Make it possible to select the months and days of the week that the user desires to analyze and not only one or "all".
  
  -Add additional statistics.
  
  -Create new functions.
  
  -Get rid of "magic strings".
